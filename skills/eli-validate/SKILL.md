description: >
  Validate spec artifacts against structural and content rules.
  Use when the user wants to check if spec artifacts are complete and well-formed
  before implementation.
user-invocable: true
---

Validate spec artifacts for a change. Checks structural completeness, content quality, and referential integrity. All violations are errors — any failure blocks implementation.

---

**Input**: The argument is a change name (e.g., `/eli-validate add-user-search`).

**Steps**

1. **Parse input**

   Extract `<change-name>` from the argument.

   If no change name provided:
   - List directories under `feature-spec/changes/` (excluding `archive/`)
   - If only one active change exists, auto-select it
   - If multiple, use **AskUserQuestion** to let the user choose
   - If none exist, report error: "No active changes found. Run `/eli-propose` first."

2. **Verify change directory exists**

   Check that `feature-spec/changes/<name>/` exists. If not, report error with available changes.

3. **Run validation checks**

   Read all artifact files and validate against the rules below. Collect ALL issues before reporting.

4. **Generate report**

   Display the validation report (see Output Format below).

### Referential Integrity

| Check | Rule |
|-------|------|

## Output Format

```
## Validation Report: <change-name>

### Results

[For each file/check, show result with icon:]
✓ proposal.md — all checks passed
✗ design.md — 2 errors
  ✗ Missing `## Risks / Trade-offs` section
  ✗ Decision "API Design" has no alternatives mentioned
✓ specs/user-search-api/spec.md — all checks passed
✗ specs/user-search-ui/spec.md — 1 error
  ✗ Requirement "Search input field" has only 1 scenario (minimum 2)
✓ tasks.md — all checks passed
✓ Referential integrity — all checks passed

### Summary

Errors: N
Total tasks: N (N complete, N pending)

### Verdict

✗ FAIL — N errors. Fix all errors before implementation.

OR

✓ PASS — 0 errors
  Ready for implementation. Run `/eli-apply <name>` to start.
```

## Guardrails

- Read ALL artifact files before generating the report (don't fail fast on first error)
- Report ALL issues found, not just the first one per file
- Group issues by file for readability
- Always show the summary and verdict
- On PASS, suggest running `/eli-apply <name>`
- On FAIL, list specific fixes needed
- Never modify artifact files — this is read-only validation
- If `feature-spec/changes/<name>/` doesn't exist, show helpful error with available changes
